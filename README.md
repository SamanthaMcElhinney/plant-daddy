# Plant Daddy ðŸŒ±

## About

Welcome to ðŸŒ± **Plant Daddy** ðŸŒ±, a mobile application developed with a focus on plant lovers without a green thumb. I initiated this project to refine my React Native and full-stack development skills. Whether you're a seasoned plant enthusiast or a beginner looking to delve into the world of plant care, Plant Daddy is for you. This application enables users to browse through plants, learning about their specific care instructions and requirements. Users can set up and manage watering schedules and receive timely notifications, ensuring each plant receives optimum care. 

During the development journey of this application, I've explored and challenged myself with various technologies and development practices, focusing on delivering a responsive and user-friendly experience using React Native, end to end testing with Cypress, and other modern technologies.
